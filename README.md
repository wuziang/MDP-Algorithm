# MDP-Algorithm
NTU  AY2021S2

by Raymond Hartono, Ziang Wu

`main` branch:

- a fork of algorithms by [Suyash Lakhotia](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/MDPAlgorithm)

- two improved implementations, `basic` and `pledge` 

`basic` branch:

- a star search algorithm (fastest path)
  
- right-handed traversing algorithm (exploration/image processing)


- stabilize sensor data and auto-recover from deadlock

- improve coverage by extra exploration

- structural refactoring and code cleanups

`pledge` branch:

- right-handed pledge algorithm (exploration/image processing)
